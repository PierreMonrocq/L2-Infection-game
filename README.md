# L2-Infection-game
Implementation of game theory algorithms (Min max, Alpha Beta, Negamax) on an infection game problem (attacker-defender).

Project in Java completed in 2018. This infection game involves a network of machines with an attacker and a defender. The network is modelled by a graph where the machines are connected to each other. At each turn, the defender can cut links to prevent contamination, while the attacker contaminates a machine.

The objective was to develop game theory algorithms for this problem and to observe the results.
